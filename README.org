#+title: Choices: build SPA to let users explore a (decision-)tree

* =Choices=

=Choices= lets you build a single page application to let users traverse
a set of related options and get feedback from their choices.

[[file:choices.png]]

* Build

1. Copy =config-example.yml= to =config.yml= and adapt it to your needs
3. Test your configuration with =clj -A:test=
4. Compile with =clj -A:js=
5. Your static files are ready in =resources/public/=

* Develop

1. Copy =config-example.yml= to =config.yml= and adapt it to your needs
2. Compile with =clj -A:fig=
3. Check your web browser on http://localhost:9500

* Themes

=Choices= come with three themes: [[https://bulma.io/][bulma]], the default, [[https://jenil.github.io/chota/][chota]] and [[https://www.systeme-de-design.gouv.fr/][dsfr]].

*Don't use the dsfr theme unless you are [[https://www.systeme-de-design.gouv.fr/utilisation-et-organisation/perimetre-d-application][authorized]] to.*

To set chota as the theme, run =clj -X:set theme chota=.

This will update =config.yml= and =resources/public/index.html= to use
chota as the theme when generating the static website.
